# Fractal Generator

This project is a simple **Fractal Generator** built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to generate different types of fractals (e.g., Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship, etc.) and export the fractal images as both **SVG** and **PNG** files. 

## Features

- **Generate Fractals**: Select from various fractal types, including Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship, Newton, Phoenix, and Celtic Knot.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Define the width, height, and maximum iterations for fractal generation.
- **Real-time Preview**: View the generated fractal directly in the browser using SVG format.
- **Download as SVG or PNG**: Save the generated fractal as either an SVG file or a PNG image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript. This project uses the D3.js library for color interpolation.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdomarrok/fractal-generator.git
    cd fractal-generator
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start generating fractals.

### Usage

1. **Select a fractal type**: Choose from the dropdown menu which fractal you want to generate.
2. **Set custom dimensions**: Adjust the width and height to your desired size.
3. **Define the number of iterations**: Set the maximum number of iterations for fractal calculations.
4. **Generate Fractal**: Click the "Generate and Preview Fractal" button to see the fractal on the screen.
5. **Download Image**: After generating, download the fractal as an SVG or PNG by clicking the respective download links.
